Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York . [ 27 ] They had three children: Joseph R. \\\"Beau\\\" Biden III , Robert Hunter Biden , and Naomi Christina \\\"Amy\\\" Biden. [ 23 ] Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. In his first year of law school, he failed a course because he plagiarized a law review article, but the failing grade was later stricken. His grades were relatively poor, and he graduated 76th in a class of 85. [ 22 ] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969. [ 1 ] Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett in 1968 and self-identified as a Republican. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry 's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson , who defeated Terry in 1968. [ 28 ] Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden, but he registered as an independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon . [ 28 ] Law practices Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a law firm headed by a locally active Democrat, [ 30 ] [ 28 ] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party; [ 31 ] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat. [ 28 ] He and another attorney also formed a law firm. [ 30 ] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well. [ 10 ] He supplemented his income by managing properties. [ 32 ] Biden ran for the fourth district seat on the New Castle County Council in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] He served until January 1, 1973. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods. [ 38 ] Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war. [ 39 ] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments. Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \\\" asthma as a teenager\\\" was the reason. [ 40 ] 1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware Main article: 1972 United States Senate election in Delaware Neilia Hunter, Joe, Hunter, Naomi Christina and Beau Biden, c. â 1972 Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, was thought to have no chance of winning. [ 30 ] [ 10 ] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers, [ 41 ] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size. [ 32 ] He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell . [ 30 ] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with \\\"politics as usual\\\". [ 30 ] [ 41 ] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points, [ 30 ] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage, [ 15 ] and he won with 50.5% of the vote. [ 41 ] Death of wife and daughter A few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident in Hockessin, Delaware , on December 18, 1972. [ 23 ] [ 42 ] Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were in the car and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. [ 43 ] Biden considered resigning to care for them, [ 15 ] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to. [ 44 ] Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] He wrote that he \\\"felt God had played a horrible trick\\\" on him [ 47 ] and had trouble focusing on work. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Second marriage Biden and his second wife, Jill , met in 1975 and married in 1977 Biden met teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date . [ 50 ] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977, [ 51 ] [ 52 ] and spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life. [ 55 ] In 1981, the couple had a daughter, Ashley Biden , [ 23 ] who is a social worker, activist, and fashion designer. [ 56 ] Jill helped raise her stepsons, Hunter and Beau, who were seven and eight respectively at the time of her marriage. Hunter has worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings, personal life , and legal troubles have come under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency. In December 2024, Biden pardoned Hunter following his conviction on gun and tax charges despite repeated promises that he would not do so. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Beau became an Army judge-advocate in Iraq and later Delaware attorney general [ 61 ] before dying of brain cancer in 2015.

[ 66 ] Aged 30 when first elected, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history . [ 67 ] He was junior senator to William Roth until Roth was defeated in 2000. [ 68 ] He remains one of the longest-serving senators in U.S. history. [ 69 ] Senate activities Biden with President Jimmy Carter , 1978 During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability. [ 70 ] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription . [ 71 ] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Governor Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary . Carter won the Democratic nomination and the 1976 election . [ 72 ] Biden also worked on arms control . [ 73 ] [ 74 ] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Carter, Biden met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections. [ 75 ] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its policy of apartheid . [ 28 ] In a congressional hearing in 1984, he objected to the Strategic Defense Initiative plan to construct autonomous systems of ICBM defense. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Equality movements In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing . His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies. [ 78 ] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely. [ 79 ] Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. [ 78 ] He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978. [ 80 ] Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan , 1984 Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time. [ 81 ] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act , which included a ban on assault weapons , [ 82 ] [ 83 ] and the Violence Against Women Act , [ 84 ] which he has called his most significant legislation. [ 85 ] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration; [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Biden later expressed regret for passing the bill. [ 88 ] Biden meeting with attorney general Janet Reno , 1993 Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gay people from serving in the armed forces. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act , which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring people in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same. [ 91 ] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in ObergefellÂ v. Hodges . [ 92 ] Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and ClintonâLewinsky scandal investigations, saying \\\"it's going to be a cold day in hell\\\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers. [ 93 ] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of Bill Clinton . [ 94 ] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers. [ 15 ] Bill Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act , [ 15 ] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it. [ 95 ] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security. [ 66 ] [ 96 ] Brain surgeries In February 1988, after several episodes of severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm . [ 97 ] [ 98 ] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism . [ 98 ] A second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] His recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months. [ 100 ] Senate Judiciary Committee Biden speaking at the signing of the 1994 Crime Bill with President Bill Clinton . Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary . He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997. [ 101 ] As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings. [ 15 ] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval â â â given in an interview the previous year â â â of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered, [ 102 ] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents, [ 15 ] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text. [ 103 ] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5â9 vote [ 103 ] and then in the full Senate, 42â58.

[ 110 ] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator Biden accompanies President Clinton and other officials to Bosnia and Herzegovina , December 1997. Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009. [ 111 ] His positions were generally liberal internationalist . [ 73 ] [ 112 ] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party. [ 111 ] [ 112 ] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy. [ 113 ] Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991. [ 112 ] He became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. [ 73 ] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \\\" lift and strike \\\" policy. [ 73 ] [ 111 ] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement. [ 73 ] [ 112 ] In April 1993, Biden had a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ . [ 114 ] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement. [ 114 ] He has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his \\\"proudest moment in public life\\\" related to foreign policy. [ 112 ] In 1999, during the Kosovo War , Biden supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia . [ 73 ] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront MiloÅ¡eviÄ over Yugoslav actions toward Kosovo Albanians . [ 112 ] [ 115 ] Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq Main article: War on terror Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi in Baghdad in 2004. Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan , saying, \\\"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\\\" [ 116 ] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \\\"eliminate\\\" that threat. [ 117 ] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq , approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq . [ 112 ] As chair of the committee, he assembled witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his government, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction . [ 118 ] Biden eventually became a critic of the war, calling his vote a \\\"mistake\\\" by 2005, [ 119 ] [ 120 ] but did not push for withdrawal. [ 112 ] [ 114 ] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \\\"level with the American people\\\" about its cost and length. [ 111 ] [ 115 ] By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007 , [ 112 ] [ 114 ] saying General David Petraeus was \\\"dead, flat wrong\\\" in believing the surge could work. [ 121 ] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate, [ 124 ] but the idea failed to gain traction. [ 121 ]\",\n",

His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies. [ 78 ] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely. [ 79 ] Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. [ 78 ] He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978. [ 80 ] Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan , 1984 Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984.

[ 81 ] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act , which included a ban on assault weapons , [ 82 ] [ 83 ] and the Violence Against Women Act , [ 84 ] which he has called his most significant legislation.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act , which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring people in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same. [ 91 ] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in ObergefellÂ v. Hodges . [ 92 ] Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and ClintonâLewinsky scandal investigations, saying \\\"it's going to be a cold day in hell\\\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers. [ 93 ] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of Bill Clinton . [ 94 ] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.

[ 148 ] On August 22, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate .

[ 155 ] [ 156 ] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks.

[ 147 ] : â 411â414, â 419 â Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \\\"Joe bombs\\\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which irked Biden. [ 159 ] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership. [ 147 ] : â 411â414 â As the 2008 financial crisis reached a peak in September 2008, and the proposed Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 Â billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , which passed in the Senate. [ 160 ] On October 2, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis . Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had still won the debate overall. [ 161 ] On November 4, Obama and Biden were elected .

Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton. [ 171 ] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement, [ 171 ] and White House officials later said Obama himself never entertained the idea.

Inauguration Main article: Inauguration of Joe Biden Biden takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at the Capitol , January 20, 2021. Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021. [ 325 ] [ 326 ] At 78, he became the oldest person to assume the office. [ 325 ] [ 327 ] He was the second Catholic U.S. president, after John F. Kennedy , [ 328 ] [ 329 ] and the first president elected from the state of Delaware . [ 330 ] He was also the first person since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, [ 331 ] and the only president to date from the Silent Generation . [ 332 ] [ 333 ] Biden's inauguration was \\\"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\\\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack . Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration. [ 334 ] First 100 days See also: First 100 days of Joe Biden's presidency In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement , ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico , directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization , face mask requirements on federal property , measures to combat hunger in the United States , [ 335 ] [ 336 ] [ 337 ] [ 338 ] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline . [ 339 ] [ 340 ] [ 341 ] Biden with his Cabinet , July 2021 On March 11, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 , a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 342 ] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit . Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats removed it. [ 343 ] [ 344 ] [ 345 ] Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico , Biden said migrant adults were \\\"being sent back\\\", in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations. [ 346 ] He earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them, leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help. [ 347 ] On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years. [ 348 ] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021. [ 349 ] Biden's decision met with a range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support. [ 350 ] On April 22â23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%â52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. [ 351 ] [ 352 ] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress . [ 353 ] Domestic policy On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act , which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday . [ 354 ] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant , Biden said that it was \\\"gigantically important\\\" for Americans to be vaccinated. [ 355 ] In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act . [ 356 ] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it. [ 357 ] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency. [ 358 ] Biden supported the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas ; [ 359 ] he signed the bill on June 25, 2022. [ 360 ] The Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022. [ 361 ] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits , during military service. [ 362 ] In 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act , which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages. [ 363 ] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive action offering amnesty to unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens. The program included a pathway to U.S. residency and citizenship and was expected to initially affect about 500,000 people. It was later struck down due to a lack of legislation empowering the president to enact the program. [ 364 ] [ 365 ] In January 2025, Biden declared the lapsed Equal Rights Amendment ratified as the \\\"28th Amendment\\\" to the constitution . The declaration has no formal effect [ 366 ] [ 367 ] and the National Archives has said it does not intend to certify the amendment as part of the constitution due to \\\"established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions\\\". [ 368 ] Economy Main article: Economic policy of the Joe Biden administration Inflation rate, United States and eurozone, January 2018 through November 2024 Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation . Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years. [ 369 ] [ 370 ] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year. [ 371 ] [ 372 ] [ 373 ] By the end of 2021, inflation rates measured by the consumer price index (CPI) reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years. The inflation rate peaked at 9% in June 2022. [ 374 ] [ 375 ] [ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 378 ] The inflation rate reached 2.9% and core inflation rate reached 3.2% on an annual basis in December 2024, the last full month of Biden's term. Between December 2020 and December 2024, CPI rose 21.3% overall, with an annualized inflation rate of 5.3% throughout Biden's term in office. The inflation rate remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target every month since March 2021, resulting in elevated interest rates to combat inflation. Average wages increased 19% throughout Biden's presidency, falling behind inflation. The unemployment rate declined by over 2% and real GDP grew 11% during Biden's term. Total household net worth increased by 28%, largely driven by stocks and real estate. The national debt grew to $36.2 trillion, with a debt to GDP ratio of 123% and a deficit to GDP ratio of 6% in FY 2024. [ 379 ] [ 374 ] [ 380 ] Percentage of uninsured Americans under age 65 from 2010 to 2022. The number and percentage of those uninsured under Biden fell to their lowest levels since 1997. [ 381 ] Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices , Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022. [ 382 ] [ 383 ] [ 384 ] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008 [ 385 ] [ 386 ] [ 387 ] before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending. [ 388 ] [ 389 ] [ 390 ] Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress , including the American Rescue Plan , Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , CHIPS and Science Act , and the Inflation Reduction Act . [ 391 ] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022. [ 392 ] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors , to compete economically with China . [ 393 ] In his third month in office, Biden also signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022. [ 394 ] [ 395 ] His administration rigorously enforced antitrust law . In 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions. [ 396 ] During the United Auto Workers strike , he expressed support for the workers in negotiations. [ 397 ] Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line. [ 398 ] He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024. [ 399 ] Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed , triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion . After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed , the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers. [ 400 ] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure. [ 401 ] At the beginning of the 118th Congress , Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit , which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt. [ 402 ] Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 , which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default. [ 403 ] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden. [ 404 ] [ 405 ] Biden extended the COVID-19 student loan pause through September 2023, with an \\\"on ramp\\\" period that extended some of the pause's protections against credit reporting, collection efforts, and late payment fees through September 30, 2024. [ 406 ] The Biden administration's attempts to implement student loan forgiveness and relief programs have faced legal challenges from a coalition of Republican-led states. [ 407 ] Biden's plans to forgive student loan debt were estimated to cost over $519 billion, [ 408 ] and some critics called them a \\\"disaster\\\". [ 409 ] Judiciary Further information: List of federal judges appointed by Joe Biden Biden and Ketanji Brown Jackson watching the U.S. Senate vote on her confirmation, April 2022 By the end of 2021, 40 of his nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan . [ 410 ] Biden prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color. [ 411 ] In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer announced his intention to retire. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred, [ 412 ] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement. [ 413 ] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson . [ 414 ] She was sworn in on June 30. [ 415 ] By the end of his presidency, Biden had appointed 235 judges, more appointments in a single term than any other president in at least 50 years. 63% of Biden's judges were women and 60% were non-white. [ 416 ] [ 417 ] Biden expressed interest in judicial term limits and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices. [ 418 ] Infrastructure and climate Further information: Build Back Better Plan and Environmental policy of the Joe Biden administration Biden, then UK prime minister Boris Johnson and UN secretary-general AntÃ³nio Guterres at the opening ceremony of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 1, 2021 As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan , a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development. [ 419 ] [ 420 ] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , [ 421 ] [ 422 ] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband. [ 423 ] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021. [ 424 ] The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act , a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change. [ 425 ] [ 426 ] Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation , but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin , even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion. [ 427 ] After Manchin rejected the bill, [ 428 ] it was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 , covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform. [ 429 ] The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer . [ 430 ] [ 431 ] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change , $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform . [ 432 ] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. [ 433 ] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51â50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie . Biden signed the bill on August 16. [ 434 ] [ 435 ] Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort. [ 436 ] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024. [ 437 ] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions. [ 438 ] In July 2023, when heat waves hit the United States , Biden announced measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change. [ 439 ] [ 440 ] In April 2024, he unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000 km of waterways). [ 441 ] Biden protected 674 million acres of land and ocean from natural resource exploitation, more than any other president. The vast majority of the conservation came from a ban on offshore drilling in 625 million acres of ocean. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Immigration Main article: Immigration policy of the Joe Biden administration Yearly numbers of illegal immigrants apprehended at the U.S. southern border Illegal border crossings at the MexicoâUnited States border began to surge in 2021 when Biden assumed office, [ 444 ] [ 445 ] [ 446 ] [ 447 ] reaching an all-time monthly high in December 2023. [ 448 ] [ 449 ] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants. [ 450 ] [ 451 ] [ 452 ] Deportations from October 2023 to September 2024 reached the highest level since 2014. [ 453 ] Biden used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants had been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024. [ 454 ] [ 455 ] [ 456 ] Biden visiting border patrol agents at the U.S. southern border, January 2023 In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford . He had previously supported the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 , which he proposed on his first day in office. [ 457 ] [ 458 ] The proposed bipartisan bill would have allowed DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day. [ 459 ] [ 460 ] In addition, the bill would have mandated the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries. [ 461 ] While not addressing the status of \\\" Dreamers \\\", it would have changed immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they turn 21, and provide additional funding for immigration judges. [ 462 ] Former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action. [ 463 ] [ 464 ] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border. [ 465 ] [ 466 ] [ 467 ] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax. [ 468 ] [ 469 ] On January 17, 2024, a Republican-led non-binding resolution denouncing the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the U.S. southern border passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 225â187, with 211 Republicans and 14 Democrats supporting it. [ 470 ] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice. [ 471 ] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive order allowing the president to restrict the MexicoâU.S. border. [ 472 ] [ 450 ] Pardons and commutations Biden issued more individual pardons and commutations than any other president. [ 473 ] On October 6, 2022, he pardoned all Americans convicted of \\\"small\\\" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law. [ 474 ] On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans for cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted. [ 475 ] [ 476 ] On December 12, 2024, in the largest single-day clemency act in history, Biden granted clemency to about 1,500 nonviolent felons in home confinement who had previously been released from prison. [ 477 ] [ 478 ] The act generated controversy, as it included felons such as Michael Conahan , a judge involved in the kids for cash kickback scandal , and Rita Crundwell , a comptroller responsible for the single largest municipal fraud in U.S. history. The Biden administration said the offenders who received clemency \\\"deserve a second chance\\\" and were selected based on meeting certain criteria in a uniform decision. [ 479 ] [ 480 ] On December 23, 2024, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates. [ 481 ] On his last day in office, Biden commuted the sentence of Leonard Peltier , convicted of murdering two FBI agents, to house arrest. [ 482 ] Pardons of family members and political figures Pardon dated December 1, 2024 Biden issued more pardons for members of his family than any other president. [ 483 ] On December 1, 2024, he issued a \\\"full and unconditional\\\" pardon to Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses between 2014 and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was \\\"unprecedented\\\". [ 484 ] According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Richard Nixon 's or other \\\"controversial\\\" [ 484 ] pardons: The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014âthe year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers. Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise. [ 485 ] [ 486 ] [ 57 ] Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff. [ 487 ] In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was \\\"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\\\", blaming \\\"political pressure\\\" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction. [ 60 ] [ 488 ] [ 489 ] Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution. [ 487 ] Biden said, \\\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\\\" [ 490 ] On his last day in office, Biden issued pardons for more of his family members and other high-profile figures. [ 483 ] The pardons covered Biden's siblings and their spouses, including James Biden , who was interviewed as part of an impeachment probe into Biden. Others pardoned that day include former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley , former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci , and members and participants in the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack , despite many of those pardoned not having been under criminal investigation. [ 483 ] [ 473 ] Biden justified the pardons by citing his concern about \\\"baseless and politically motivated investigations\\\" during Trump's second term. [ 491 ] [ 492 ] [ 493 ] Biden added that the pardons were preemptive and should not be seen as implying their recipients' guilt. [ 494 ] [ 495 ] The pardons Biden granted to his family and other political figures had a sweeping scope similar to the one he granted Hunter, covering federal offenses the recipients committed or may have committed between 2014 and the day of the pardon. [ 473 ] [ 496 ] Biden also pardoned two other Democratic officials on his last day in office: Ernest William Cromartie, convicted of tax evasion , and Gerald G. Lundergan , convicted of a scheme to funnel money to his daughter's Senate campaign. [ 497 ] [ 498 ] [ 499 ] 2022 elections Main article: 2022 United States elections Biden holding a rally at Bowie State University in Maryland for gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore , November 7, 2022 On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech , Biden called for a \\\"battle for the soul of the nation\\\". Off camera, he called Trump supporters \\\"semi-fascists\\\", which Republican commentators denounced. [ 500 ] [ 501 ] [ 502 ] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives , [ 503 ] [ 504 ] [ 505 ] [ 506 ] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate . [ 507 ] [ i ] It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the incumbent president's party achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers. [ 511 ] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly strong performance, [ 512 ] but they likely overperformed for other reasons, including the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and poor Republican candidate quality in many races. [ 513 ] [ 514 ] Foreign policy Main article: Foreign policy of the Joe Biden administration In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president, visiting Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit , a NATO summit , and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin . [ 515 ] In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS , a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \\\"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific \\\". [ 516 ] In February 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen and revoked the designation of Yemen's Houthis as terrorists. [ 517 ] [ 518 ] In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi , the second leader of the Islamic State . [ 519 ] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri , the second leader of Al-Qaeda , and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks . [ 520 ] The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, threatening a longstanding alliance . [ 521 ] [ 522 ] In August 2024, Biden negotiated and oversaw the 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange , the largest prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War . It involved the release of 26 people, including journalist Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan . [ 523 ] In November 2024, the Biden administration announced that it had helped broker a ceasefire agreement in the IsraelâHezbollah conflict . [ 524 ] [ 525 ] [ 526 ] [ 527 ] Withdrawal from Afghanistan Main article: 2020â2021 U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan Biden in a video conference with Vice President Kamala Harris and the U.S. National Security team , discussing the Fall of Kabul on August 15, 2021 American forces had begun withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline. [ 528 ] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1. [ 529 ] [ 530 ] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn. [ 349 ] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \\\"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\\\" [ 349 ] On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country. [ 349 ] [ 531 ] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist with evacuating American personnel and Afghan allies. [ 532 ] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal, [ 533 ] with the evacuations described as chaotic and botched. [ 534 ] [ 535 ] [ 536 ] On August 16, Biden addressed the \\\"messy\\\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \\\"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\\\". [ 531 ] [ 537 ] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \\\"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\\\". [ 537 ] [ 538 ] On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \\\"planners and facilitators\\\", according to a U.S. Army general. [ 539 ] The U.S. military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans, and other allies \\\"an extraordinary success\\\". [ 540 ] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left. [ 541 ] After the withdrawal, the U.S. continued to send aid to Afghanistan, remaining its biggest aid donor as of August 2024 and spending at least $20.7 billion post-withdrawal. U.S. funding has helped support the Taliban government and stabilize Afghanistan's economy. [ 542 ] [ 543 ] On September 25, 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Biden administration for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, with ten Democrats and all Republicans voting in favor. [ 544 ] Russian invasion of Ukraine Biden with refugees from Ukraine in Warsaw , Poland, March 2022 In February 2022, the Russian Armed Forces under President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine . After warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden responded by imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine . [ 545 ] [ 546 ] [ 547 ] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine, [ 548 ] [ 549 ] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion. [ 550 ] [ 551 ] [ 552 ] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging energy and food crises . [ 553 ] [ 554 ] [ 555 ] In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine. [ 556 ] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead, [ 557 ] but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 Â billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024. [ 558 ] [ 559 ] [ 560 ] Actually delivered aid often differed from announced levels and was also often delayed. The Government Accountability Office and Pentagon Inspector General found that the Biden administration seemed unaware of the pace of weapons deliveries. [ 561 ] Throughout the conflict, Biden consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia . An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of Kharkiv for \\\"counter-fire\\\" purposes. [ 562 ] [ 563 ] [ 564 ] [ 565 ] Biden also blocked access for some weapons systems altogether, typically citing fears of escalation, only to permit deliveries for some weapons later on. [ 566 ] [ 567 ] [ 568 ] [ 569 ] [ 570 ] China affairs Further information: ChinaâUnited States relations Â§ Â Biden administration (2021â2025) Biden with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the G20 summit in Bali , November 14, 2022 The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm in late 2022, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal. [ 571 ] [ 572 ] [ 573 ] In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes , Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \\\"an unprecedented attack\\\" by the Chinese, [ 574 ] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \\\" strategic ambiguity \\\" toward China and Taiwan. [ 575 ] [ 576 ] [ 577 ] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. [ 578 ] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed. [ 578 ] [ 579 ] [ 575 ] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy. [ 580 ] On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina . [ 581 ] [ 582 ] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian airship that had blown off course. [ 583 ] [ 584 ] Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations. [ 585 ] [ 586 ] [ 587 ] In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China. [ 588 ] It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials. [ 588 ] In April 2024, Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act , which would ban social networking services if they are determined by the president and relevant provisions to be a \\\"foreign adversary controlled application\\\". The act explicitly applies to ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries, which are based in China. It ceases to be applicable if the application is divested and no longer considered to be controlled by a foreign adversary of the United States . Biden had signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act in December 2022, prohibiting the use of TikTok on devices owned by the federal government. [ 589 ] [ 590 ] [ 591 ] Gaza war Further information: United States support for Israel in the Gaza war Biden with Israeli president Isaac Herzog and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 18, 2023 In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into an intensified conflict , jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia . [ 592 ] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel and condemned the attack by Hamas. [ 593 ] He deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war, [ 594 ] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel. [ 595 ] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip . [ 596 ] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \\\"humanitarian pauses\\\" to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip . [ 597 ] He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses. [ 598 ] He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. [ 599 ] Biden has said he is a Zionist . [ 600 ] [ 601 ] He has faced criticism for his unwavering support for Israel. Officials have urged him to take a harder stance against Israel, criticizing his administration's leniency and support despite the Israeli government's contentious offensive, which has led to significant civilian casualties and humanitarian crises .

[ 605 ] On March 3, the U.S. military began airdropping food aid into Gaza. [ 606 ] Several experts called the U.S. airdrops performative and said they would do little to alleviate the famine in Gaza . [ 607 ] As of May 2024, Biden has continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread protests . A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war. [ 608 ] Beginning in April 2024, widespread Gaza war protests emerged on university campuses , denouncing Biden. [ 609 ] On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli ceasefire proposal, saying that Hamas was \\\"no longer capable\\\" of another large-scale attack. [ 610 ] [ 611 ] [ 612 ] The proposal, which would establish a permanent ceasefire, release all hostages, and reconstruct the Gaza Strip , was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by Egypt and Qatar . [ 613 ] [ 614 ] The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding \\\"the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities\\\" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire. [ 615 ] [ 616 ] [ 617 ] In the first year of the war, it was estimated that the Biden administration had sent Israel at least $17.9 billion in military aid, a record. [ 618 ] In about the same period, it sent Palestinians $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid. [ 619 ] In the last week of Biden's presidency, Qatari officials announced that Hamas had accepted the ceasefire deal, with 33 hostages to be released pending Israeli approval. Biden hailed the deal, saying \\\"it is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin\\\" in a press release the same day. [ 620 ] [ 621 ] NATO enlargement Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine , Biden expressed support for expanding NATO to cover Sweden and Finland . [ 622 ] [ 623 ] On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for the two countries' entry into NATO. [ 624 ] [ 625 ] Finnish ascension occurred on April 4, 2023, but opposition by Turkey and Hungary to Swedish entry led to a stalemate. [ 626 ] Biden led diplomatic talks resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024. [ 627 ] [ 628 ] He has also expressed openness to Ukrainian entry into NATO following the end of the conflict, [ 629 ] supporting an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of steps such as the Membership Action Plan typically required for NATO entry. [ 630 ] [ 631 ] Investigations Retention of classified documents Main article: Joe Biden classified documents incident In November 2022, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating from his vice presidency in a \\\"locked closet\\\" at the Penn Biden Center . [ 632 ] [ 633 ] According to the White House, the documents were reported to the U.S. National Archives , which recovered them the next day. [ 633 ] On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation. [ 634 ] [ 635 ] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington residence. [ 636 ] On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate \\\"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\\\". [ 637 ] On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence. [ 638 ] FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information. [ 639 ] On February 8, 2024, Hur announced that no charges would be brought against Biden. [ 640 ] Business activities Main article: United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family Further information: Impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden On January 11, 2023, the House of Representatives launched an investigative committee into the foreign business activities of Biden's son, Hunter , and brother, James . [ 641 ] The committee's chair, Representative James Comer , simultaneously investigated alleged corruption related to the Hunter Biden laptop controversy . [ 642 ] On September 12, House speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that the House investigations \\\"paint a picture of corruption\\\" by Biden and his family. [ 643 ] [ 644 ] [ 645 ] [ 646 ] Congressional investigations, including by the House Oversight committee , have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden as of December 2023. [ 647 ] [ 648 ] [ 649 ] [ 650 ] On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221â212 to formalize an impeachment inquiry into Biden . [ 651 ] [ 652 ] [ 653 ] In February 2024, Alexander Smirnov , a former intelligence informant who was prominent in the bribery allegations against Biden, was charged with making false statements . [ 654 ] Smirnov admitted he had publicized a false story given to him by Russian intelligence officials with the goal of damaging Biden's reelection campaign. [ 655 ] [ 656 ] [ 657 ] Age and health concerns Main article: Age and health concerns about Joe Biden Biden's 81st birthday cake Biden was the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. His cognitive health was perceived to have declined by Republicans and some media figures, [ 658 ] [ 659 ] and privately by some Democrats. Members of Biden's family and White House staffers insulated Biden from scrutiny of his advanced aging and decline in acuity. [ 660 ] [ 661 ] [ 662 ] The media widely covered public concern about Biden's mental acuity after a weak performance in a June 2024 presidential debate, [ 659 ] but gave it limited coverage beforehand, in part due to harsh pushback from White House officials. [ 663 ] Biden repeatedly said he was fit to serve two terms as president, [ 664 ] but later acknowledged that he may have been too old to serve a second term. [ 665 ] Upon concluding the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents , special counsel Robert Hur suggested that Biden would be able to present himself to a jury as an \\\"elderly man with poor memory\\\" and wrote that his memory \\\"appeared to have significant limitations\\\". [ 666 ] On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms. [ 667 ] [ 668 ] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid . [ 668 ] [ 669 ] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days [ 670 ] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30, 2022. [ 671 ] [ 672 ] On July 17, 2024, Biden again tested positive for COVID-19. [ 673 ] [ 674 ] 2024 presidential campaign Main article: Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign Further information: 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries , Abandon Biden , 2024 Joe BidenâDonald Trump presidential debate , and Withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 United States presidential election Biden addressing the nation after his withdrawal Ending months of speculation, [ 675 ] [ 676 ] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the 2024 election , with Harris again as his running mate. [ 677 ] On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent, with most of those surveyed saying the economy was their biggest concern. [ 678 ] During his campaign, Biden promoted higher economic growth and recovery . [ 679 ] [ 680 ] He frequently stated his intention to \\\"finish the job\\\" as a political rallying cry. [ 677 ] [ 681 ] [ 682 ] U.S. Representative Dean Phillips ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries, [ 683 ] campaigning as a younger alternative who would be a stronger opponent to Trump. [ 684 ] [ 685 ] Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23 New Hampshire primary , but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote. [ 686 ] He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96.2% of the vote. [ 687 ] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan . On March 5 (\\\"Super Tuesday\\\"), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13. [ 688 ] [ 689 ] Biden lost the American Samoa contest to venture capitalist Jason Palmer , becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since Jimmy Carter in 1980 . [ 690 ] On March 6, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden. [ 691 ] On March 12, Biden reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee. [ 692 ] [ 693 ] [ 694 ] The first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers. [ 695 ] [ 696 ] [ 697 ] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump the winner, [ 698 ] [ 699 ] [ 700 ] [ 701 ] and polling indicated the majority of viewers believed Trump won. [ 702 ] After the debate raised questions about his health and age , Biden faced calls to withdraw from the race, including from fellow Democrats [ 703 ] and the editorial boards of several major news outlets. [ 704 ] [ 705 ] Biden and President-elect Donald Trump meet in the Oval Office as part of the presidential transition on November 13, 2024 Biden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate, [ 706 ] but on July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, writing that this was \\\"in the best interest of my party and the country\\\". [ 707 ] [ 708 ] He endorsed Harris as his successor. [ 709 ] [ 710 ] On August 6, 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee. [ 711 ] This was the first time an eligible incumbent had declined to run for reelection since 1968 . [ 712 ] In the general election, Trump defeated Harris. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 2018. In a nationally televised speech after the election, Biden congratulated Trump and promised a \\\"peaceful and orderly\\\" transition of power. [ 713 ] In a January 2025 interview, Biden claimed he could have defeated Trump had he not been persuaded to withdraw from the election, despite lagging behind Trump in polling. [ 714 ] [ 715 ] A YouGov poll conducted on November 6â7, 2024, found that if Biden had been the Democratic nominee, Trump would have won the popular vote by 49% to 42%. Trump won the popular vote over Harris by 49.8% to 48.3%. [ 716 ] Assessments A February 2024 American Political Science Association poll of historians and scholars ranked Biden as the 14th-greatest president, diverging from public assessments. The pollsters noted that Biden's ranking was unusually high for a presidency without military victories or institutional expansion, and with personal scandals such as Hunter Biden's. The experts polled generally regarded Biden's signature accomplishment as his victory over Trump in the 2020 election, which was perceived as helping to protect and restore political and institutional norms in American government. [ 717 ] [ 718 ] [ 719 ] Journalist Amy Walter , editor of the nonpartisan The Cook Political Report , argued that Biden's presidency was deemed a failure by the public particularly due to frustration over inflation. Walter said that voters considered inflation the most important factor with respect to the economy, more important than the stock market, low unemployment, or household income. [ 720 ] The extent to which Biden's policies were responsible for inflation is debated by economists, [ 721 ] but according to Gallup, public perception of the economy in 2024 was worse only in 2008 and 1992, helping Trump win the 2024 presidential election.

[ 342 ] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit . Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats removed it. [ 343 ] [ 344 ] [ 345 ] Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico , Biden said migrant adults were \\\"being sent back\\\", in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations. [ 346 ] He earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them, leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.

[ 356 ] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.

[ 363 ] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive action offering amnesty to unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens. The program included a pathway to U.S. residency and citizenship and was expected to initially affect about 500,000 people. It was later struck down due to a lack of legislation empowering the president to enact the program. [ 364 ] [ 365 ] In January 2025, Biden declared the lapsed Equal Rights Amendment ratified as the \\\"28th Amendment\\\" to the constitution . The declaration has no formal effect [ 366 ] [ 367 ] and the National Archives has said it does not intend to certify the amendment as part of the constitution due to \\\"established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions\\\". [ 368 ] Economy Main article: Economic policy of the Joe Biden administration Inflation rate, United States and eurozone, January 2018 through November 2024 Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation . Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years. [ 369 ] [ 370 ] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year. [ 371 ] [ 372 ] [ 373 ] By the end of 2021, inflation rates measured by the consumer price index (CPI) reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years. The inflation rate peaked at 9% in June 2022. [ 374 ] [ 375 ] [ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 378 ] The inflation rate reached 2.9% and core inflation rate reached 3.2% on an annual basis in December 2024, the last full month of Biden's term. Between December 2020 and December 2024, CPI rose 21.3% overall, with an annualized inflation rate of 5.3% throughout Biden's term in office. The inflation rate remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target every month since March 2021, resulting in elevated interest rates to combat inflation. Average wages increased 19% throughout Biden's presidency, falling behind inflation. The unemployment rate declined by over 2% and real GDP grew 11% during Biden's term. Total household net worth increased by 28%, largely driven by stocks and real estate. The national debt grew to $36.2 trillion, with a debt to GDP ratio of 123% and a deficit to GDP ratio of 6% in FY 2024. [ 379 ] [ 374 ] [ 380 ] Percentage of uninsured Americans under age 65 from 2010 to 2022. The number and percentage of those uninsured under Biden fell to their lowest levels since 1997. [ 381 ] Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices , Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022. [ 382 ] [ 383 ] [ 384 ] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008 [ 385 ] [ 386 ] [ 387 ] before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending. [ 388 ] [ 389 ] [ 390 ] Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress , including the American Rescue Plan , Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , CHIPS and Science Act , and the Inflation Reduction Act . [ 391 ] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022. [ 392 ] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors , to compete economically with China . [ 393 ] In his third month in office, Biden also signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022. [ 394 ] [ 395 ] His administration rigorously enforced antitrust law . In 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions. [ 396 ] During the United Auto Workers strike , he expressed support for the workers in negotiations. [ 397 ] Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line. [ 398 ] He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024. [ 399 ] Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed , triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion . After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed , the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers. [ 400 ] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure. [ 401 ] At the beginning of the 118th Congress , Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit , which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt. [ 402 ] Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 , which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default. [ 403 ] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden. [ 404 ] [ 405 ] Biden extended the COVID-19 student loan pause through September 2023, with an \\\"on ramp\\\" period that extended some of the pause's protections against credit reporting, collection efforts, and late payment fees through September 30, 2024. [ 406 ] The Biden administration's attempts to implement student loan forgiveness and relief programs have faced legal challenges from a coalition of Republican-led states. [ 407 ] Biden's plans to forgive student loan debt were estimated to cost over $519 billion, [ 408 ] and some critics called them a \\\"disaster\\\". [ 409 ] Judiciary Further information: List of federal judges appointed by Joe Biden Biden and Ketanji Brown Jackson watching the U.S. Senate vote on her confirmation, April 2022 By the end of 2021, 40 of his nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan . [ 410 ] Biden prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color. [ 411 ] In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer announced his intention to retire. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred, [ 412 ] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement. [ 413 ] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson . [ 414 ] She was sworn in on June 30. [ 415 ] By the end of his presidency, Biden had appointed 235 judges, more appointments in a single term than any other president in at least 50 years. 63% of Biden's judges were women and 60% were non-white. [ 416 ] [ 417 ] Biden expressed interest in judicial term limits and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices. [ 418 ] Infrastructure and climate Further information: Build Back Better Plan and Environmental policy of the Joe Biden administration Biden, then UK prime minister Boris Johnson and UN secretary-general AntÃ³nio Guterres at the opening ceremony of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 1, 2021 As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan , a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development. [ 419 ] [ 420 ] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , [ 421 ] [ 422 ] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband. [ 423 ] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021. [ 424 ] The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act , a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change. [ 425 ] [ 426 ] Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation , but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin , even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion. [ 427 ] After Manchin rejected the bill, [ 428 ] it was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 , covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform. [ 429 ] The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer . [ 430 ] [ 431 ] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change , $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform . [ 432 ] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. [ 433 ] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51â50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie . Biden signed the bill on August 16. [ 434 ] [ 435 ] Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort. [ 436 ] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024. [ 437 ] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions. [ 438 ] In July 2023, when heat waves hit the United States , Biden announced measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change. [ 439 ] [ 440 ] In April 2024, he unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000 km of waterways). [ 441 ] Biden protected 674 million acres of land and ocean from natural resource exploitation, more than any other president. The vast majority of the conservation came from a ban on offshore drilling in 625 million acres of ocean. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Immigration Main article: Immigration policy of the Joe Biden administration Yearly numbers of illegal immigrants apprehended at the U.S. southern border Illegal border crossings at the MexicoâUnited States border began to surge in 2021 when Biden assumed office, [ 444 ] [ 445 ] [ 446 ] [ 447 ] reaching an all-time monthly high in December 2023. [ 448 ] [ 449 ] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants. [ 450 ] [ 451 ] [ 452 ] Deportations from October 2023 to September 2024 reached the highest level since 2014. [ 453 ] Biden used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants had been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024. [ 454 ] [ 455 ] [ 456 ] Biden visiting border patrol agents at the U.S. southern border, January 2023 In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford . He had previously supported the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 , which he proposed on his first day in office. [ 457 ] [ 458 ] The proposed bipartisan bill would have allowed DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day. [ 459 ] [ 460 ] In addition, the bill would have mandated the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries. [ 461 ] While not addressing the status of \\\" Dreamers \\\", it would have changed immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they turn 21, and provide additional funding for immigration judges. [ 462 ] Former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action. [ 463 ] [ 464 ] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border. [ 465 ] [ 466 ] [ 467 ] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax. [ 468 ] [ 469 ] On January 17, 2024, a Republican-led non-binding resolution denouncing the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the U.S. southern border passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 225â187, with 211 Republicans and 14 Democrats supporting it. [ 470 ] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice. [ 471 ] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive order allowing the president to restrict the MexicoâU.S. border. [ 472 ] [ 450 ] Pardons and commutations Biden issued more individual pardons and commutations than any other president. [ 473 ] On October 6, 2022, he pardoned all Americans convicted of \\\"small\\\" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law. [ 474 ] On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans for cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted. [ 475 ] [ 476 ] On December 12, 2024, in the largest single-day clemency act in history, Biden granted clemency to about 1,500 nonviolent felons in home confinement who had previously been released from prison. [ 477 ] [ 478 ] The act generated controversy, as it included felons such as Michael Conahan , a judge involved in the kids for cash kickback scandal , and Rita Crundwell , a comptroller responsible for the single largest municipal fraud in U.S. history. The Biden administration said the offenders who received clemency \\\"deserve a second chance\\\" and were selected based on meeting certain criteria in a uniform decision. [ 479 ] [ 480 ] On December 23, 2024, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates. [ 481 ] On his last day in office, Biden commuted the sentence of Leonard Peltier , convicted of murdering two FBI agents, to house arrest. [ 482 ] Pardons of family members and political figures Pardon dated December 1, 2024 Biden issued more pardons for members of his family than any other president. [ 483 ] On December 1, 2024, he issued a \\\"full and unconditional\\\" pardon to Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses between 2014 and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was \\\"unprecedented\\\". [ 484 ] According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Richard Nixon 's or other \\\"controversial\\\" [ 484 ] pardons: The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014âthe year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers. Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise. [ 485 ] [ 486 ] [ 57 ] Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff. [ 487 ] In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was \\\"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\\\", blaming \\\"political pressure\\\" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction. [ 60 ] [ 488 ] [ 489 ] Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution. [ 487 ] Biden said, \\\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\\\" [ 490 ] On his last day in office, Biden issued pardons for more of his family members and other high-profile figures. [ 483 ] The pardons covered Biden's siblings and their spouses, including James Biden , who was interviewed as part of an impeachment probe into Biden. Others pardoned that day include former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley , former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci , and members and participants in the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack , despite many of those pardoned not having been under criminal investigation. [ 483 ] [ 473 ] Biden justified the pardons by citing his concern about \\\"baseless and politically motivated investigations\\\" during Trump's second term. [ 491 ] [ 492 ] [ 493 ] Biden added that the pardons were preemptive and should not be seen as implying their recipients' guilt. [ 494 ] [ 495 ] The pardons Biden granted to his family and other political figures had a sweeping scope similar to the one he granted Hunter, covering federal offenses the recipients committed or may have committed between 2014 and the day of the pardon. [ 473 ] [ 496 ] Biden also pardoned two other Democratic officials on his last day in office: Ernest William Cromartie, convicted of tax evasion , and Gerald G. Lundergan , convicted of a scheme to funnel money to his daughter's Senate campaign.

Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years. [ 369 ] [ 370 ] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year. [ 371 ] [ 372 ] [ 373 ] By the end of 2021, inflation rates measured by the consumer price index (CPI) reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years. The inflation rate peaked at 9% in June 2022. [ 374 ] [ 375 ] [ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 378 ] The inflation rate reached 2.9% and core inflation rate reached 3.2% on an annual basis in December 2024, the last full month of Biden's term. Between December 2020 and December 2024, CPI rose 21.3% overall, with an annualized inflation rate of 5.3% throughout Biden's term in office. The inflation rate remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target every month since March 2021, resulting in elevated interest rates to combat inflation. Average wages increased 19% throughout Biden's presidency, falling behind inflation. The unemployment rate declined by over 2% and real GDP grew 11% during Biden's term. Total household net worth increased by 28%, largely driven by stocks and real estate. The national debt grew to $36.2 trillion, with a debt to GDP ratio of 123% and a deficit to GDP ratio of 6% in FY 2024. [ 379 ] [ 374 ] [ 380 ] Percentage of uninsured Americans under age 65 from 2010 to 2022. The number and percentage of those uninsured under Biden fell to their lowest levels since 1997. [ 381 ] Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices , Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022. [ 382 ] [ 383 ] [ 384 ] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008 [ 385 ] [ 386 ] [ 387 ] before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending. [ 388 ] [ 389 ] [ 390 ] Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress , including the American Rescue Plan , Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , CHIPS and Science Act , and the Inflation Reduction Act . [ 391 ] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022. [ 392 ] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors , to compete economically with China . [ 393 ] In his third month in office, Biden also signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022. [ 394 ] [ 395 ] His administration rigorously enforced antitrust law . In 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions. [ 396 ] During the United Auto Workers strike , he expressed support for the workers in negotiations. [ 397 ] Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line. [ 398 ] He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024. [ 399 ] Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed , triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion . After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed , the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers. [ 400 ] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure. [ 401 ] At the beginning of the 118th Congress , Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit , which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt. [ 402 ] Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 , which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default. [ 403 ] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden. [ 404 ] [ 405 ] Biden extended the COVID-19 student loan pause through September 2023, with an \\\"on ramp\\\" period that extended some of the pause's protections against credit reporting, collection efforts, and late payment fees through September 30, 2024. [ 406 ] The Biden administration's attempts to implement student loan forgiveness and relief programs have faced legal challenges from a coalition of Republican-led states. [ 407 ] Biden's plans to forgive student loan debt were estimated to cost over $519 billion, [ 408 ] and some critics called them a \\\"disaster\\\". [ 409 ]\",\n",

[ 419 ] [ 420 ] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , [ 421 ] [ 422 ] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband. [ 423 ] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021. [ 424 ] The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act , a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change. [ 425 ] [ 426 ] Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation , but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin , even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion. [ 427 ] After Manchin rejected the bill, [ 428 ] it was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 , covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform. [ 429 ] The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer . [ 430 ] [ 431 ] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change , $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform . [ 432 ] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. [ 433 ] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51â50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie . Biden signed the bill on August 16. [ 434 ] [ 435 ] Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort. [ 436 ] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024. [ 437 ] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions. [ 438 ] In July 2023, when heat waves hit the United States , Biden announced measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change. [ 439 ] [ 440 ] In April 2024, he unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000 km of waterways). [ 441 ] Biden protected 674 million acres of land and ocean from natural resource exploitation, more than any other president. The vast majority of the conservation came from a ban on offshore drilling in 625 million acres of ocean. [ 442 ] [ 443 ]\",\n",

[ 448 ] [ 449 ] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants. [ 450 ] [ 451 ] [ 452 ] Deportations from October 2023 to September 2024 reached the highest level since 2014. [ 453 ] Biden used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants had been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024. [ 454 ] [ 455 ] [ 456 ] Biden visiting border patrol agents at the U.S. southern border, January 2023 In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford . He had previously supported the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 , which he proposed on his first day in office. [ 457 ] [ 458 ] The proposed bipartisan bill would have allowed DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day. [ 459 ] [ 460 ] In addition, the bill would have mandated the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries. [ 461 ] While not addressing the status of \\\" Dreamers \\\", it would have changed immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they turn 21, and provide additional funding for immigration judges. [ 462 ] Former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action. [ 463 ] [ 464 ] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border. [ 465 ] [ 466 ] [ 467 ] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax. [ 468 ] [ 469 ] On January 17, 2024, a Republican-led non-binding resolution denouncing the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the U.S. southern border passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 225â187, with 211 Republicans and 14 Democrats supporting it. [ 470 ] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice. [ 471 ] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive order allowing the president to restrict the MexicoâU.S. border. [ 472 ] [ 450 ]\",\n",

[ 483 ] On December 1, 2024, he issued a \\\"full and unconditional\\\" pardon to Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses between 2014 and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was \\\"unprecedented\\\". [ 484 ] According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Richard Nixon 's or other \\\"controversial\\\" [ 484 ] pardons: The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014âthe year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers. Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise. [ 485 ] [ 486 ] [ 57 ] Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff. [ 487 ] In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was \\\"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\\\", blaming \\\"political pressure\\\" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction. [ 60 ] [ 488 ] [ 489 ] Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution. [ 487 ] Biden said, \\\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\\\" [ 490 ] On his last day in office, Biden issued pardons for more of his family members and other high-profile figures. [ 483 ] The pardons covered Biden's siblings and their spouses, including James Biden , who was interviewed as part of an impeachment probe into Biden. Others pardoned that day include former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley , former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci , and members and participants in the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack , despite many of those pardoned not having been under criminal investigation. [ 483 ] [ 473 ] Biden justified the pardons by citing his concern about \\\"baseless and politically motivated investigations\\\" during Trump's second term. [ 491 ] [ 492 ] [ 493 ] Biden added that the pardons were preemptive and should not be seen as implying their recipients' guilt. [ 494 ] [ 495 ] The pardons Biden granted to his family and other political figures had a sweeping scope similar to the one he granted Hunter, covering federal offenses the recipients committed or may have committed between 2014 and the day of the pardon. [ 473 ] [ 496 ] Biden also pardoned two other Democratic officials on his last day in office: Ernest William Cromartie, convicted of tax evasion , and Gerald G. Lundergan , convicted of a scheme to funnel money to his daughter's Senate campaign. [ 497 ] [ 498 ] [ 499 ]\",\n",

[ 545 ] [ 546 ] [ 547 ] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine, [ 548 ] [ 549 ] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion. [ 550 ] [ 551 ] [ 552 ] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging energy and food crises . [ 553 ] [ 554 ] [ 555 ] In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine. [ 556 ] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead, [ 557 ] but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 Â billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024. [ 558 ] [ 559 ] [ 560 ] Actually delivered aid often differed from announced levels and was also often delayed. The Government Accountability Office and Pentagon Inspector General found that the Biden administration seemed unaware of the pace of weapons deliveries. [ 561 ] Throughout the conflict, Biden consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia . An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of Kharkiv for \\\"counter-fire\\\" purposes. [ 562 ] [ 563 ] [ 564 ] [ 565 ] Biden also blocked access for some weapons systems altogether, typically citing fears of escalation, only to permit deliveries for some weapons later on. [ 566 ] [ 567 ] [ 568 ] [ 569 ] [ 570 ] China affairs Further information: ChinaâUnited States relations Â§ Â Biden administration (2021â2025) Biden with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the G20 summit in Bali , November 14, 2022 The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm in late 2022, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal. [ 571 ] [ 572 ] [ 573 ] In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes , Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \\\"an unprecedented attack\\\" by the Chinese, [ 574 ] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \\\" strategic ambiguity \\\" toward China and Taiwan. [ 575 ] [ 576 ] [ 577 ] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. [ 578 ] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed. [ 578 ] [ 579 ] [ 575 ] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy. [ 580 ] On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina . [ 581 ] [ 582 ] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian airship that had blown off course. [ 583 ] [ 584 ] Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations. [ 585 ] [ 586 ] [ 587 ] In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China. [ 588 ] It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials. [ 588 ] In April 2024, Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act , which would ban social networking services if they are determined by the president and relevant provisions to be a \\\"foreign adversary controlled application\\\". The act explicitly applies to ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries, which are based in China. It ceases to be applicable if the application is divested and no longer considered to be controlled by a foreign adversary of the United States . Biden had signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act in December 2022, prohibiting the use of TikTok on devices owned by the federal government. [ 589 ] [ 590 ] [ 591 ] Gaza war Further information: United States support for Israel in the Gaza war Biden with Israeli president Isaac Herzog and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 18, 2023 In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into an intensified conflict , jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia . [ 592 ] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel and condemned the attack by Hamas. [ 593 ] He deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war, [ 594 ] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel. [ 595 ] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip . [ 596 ] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \\\"humanitarian pauses\\\" to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip . [ 597 ] He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses. [ 598 ] He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. [ 599 ] Biden has said he is a Zionist . [ 600 ] [ 601 ] He has faced criticism for his unwavering support for Israel. Officials have urged him to take a harder stance against Israel, criticizing his administration's leniency and support despite the Israeli government's contentious offensive, which has led to significant civilian casualties and humanitarian crises .

[ 605 ] On March 3, the U.S. military began airdropping food aid into Gaza. [ 606 ] Several experts called the U.S. airdrops performative and said they would do little to alleviate the famine in Gaza . [ 607 ] As of May 2024, Biden has continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread protests . A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war. [ 608 ] Beginning in April 2024, widespread Gaza war protests emerged on university campuses , denouncing Biden. [ 609 ] On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli ceasefire proposal, saying that Hamas was \\\"no longer capable\\\" of another large-scale attack. [ 610 ] [ 611 ] [ 612 ] The proposal, which would establish a permanent ceasefire, release all hostages, and reconstruct the Gaza Strip , was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by Egypt and Qatar . [ 613 ] [ 614 ] The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding \\\"the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities\\\" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire. [ 615 ] [ 616 ] [ 617 ] In the first year of the war, it was estimated that the Biden administration had sent Israel at least $17.9 billion in military aid, a record. [ 618 ] In about the same period, it sent Palestinians $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid. [ 619 ] In the last week of Biden's presidency, Qatari officials announced that Hamas had accepted the ceasefire deal, with 33 hostages to be released pending Israeli approval. Biden hailed the deal, saying \\\"it is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin\\\" in a press release the same day. [ 620 ] [ 621 ] NATO enlargement Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine , Biden expressed support for expanding NATO to cover Sweden and Finland . [ 622 ] [ 623 ] On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for the two countries' entry into NATO. [ 624 ] [ 625 ] Finnish ascension occurred on April 4, 2023, but opposition by Turkey and Hungary to Swedish entry led to a stalemate. [ 626 ] Biden led diplomatic talks resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024. [ 627 ] [ 628 ] He has also expressed openness to Ukrainian entry into NATO following the end of the conflict, [ 629 ] supporting an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of steps such as the Membership Action Plan typically required for NATO entry.

[ 528 ] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1. [ 529 ] [ 530 ] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn. [ 349 ] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \\\"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\\\" [ 349 ] On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country. [ 349 ] [ 531 ] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist with evacuating American personnel and Afghan allies. [ 532 ] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal, [ 533 ] with the evacuations described as chaotic and botched. [ 534 ] [ 535 ] [ 536 ] On August 16, Biden addressed the \\\"messy\\\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \\\"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\\\". [ 531 ] [ 537 ] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \\\"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\\\". [ 537 ] [ 538 ] On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \\\"planners and facilitators\\\", according to a U.S. Army general. [ 539 ] The U.S. military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans, and other allies \\\"an extraordinary success\\\". [ 540 ] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left. [ 541 ] After the withdrawal, the U.S. continued to send aid to Afghanistan, remaining its biggest aid donor as of August 2024 and spending at least $20.7 billion post-withdrawal. U.S. funding has helped support the Taliban government and stabilize Afghanistan's economy. [ 542 ] [ 543 ] On September 25, 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Biden administration for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, with ten Democrats and all Republicans voting in favor.

Members of Biden's family and White House staffers insulated Biden from scrutiny of his advanced aging and decline in acuity. [ 660 ] [ 661 ] [ 662 ] The media widely covered public concern about Biden's mental acuity after a weak performance in a June 2024 presidential debate, [ 659 ] but gave it limited coverage beforehand, in part due to harsh pushback from White House officials.

As a senator, Biden was regarded as a moderate Democrat . [ 733 ] As a presidential nominee, Biden's platform had been called the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party's ideological vanguard. [ 734 ] Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching . [ 735 ] [ 736 ] [ 737 ] According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, Biden represents an Americanized form of Christian democracy , taking positions characteristic of both the center-right and center-left . [ 738 ] Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain , credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.

Johnson's withdrawal from the 1968 presidential election , with Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey , losing in 1968 to Richard Nixon and Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris , losing in 2024 to Trump. Johnson and Biden were both initially popular but saw their approval ratings decline throughout their presidencies. Johnson and Biden also previously served as vice president, under John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama, respectively. [ 838 ] A December 2024 Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans thought Biden's presidency was below average or poor, 26% average, and 19% above average or outstanding. [ 839 ] Gallup found that Americans largely offered negative assessments of Biden's presidency on economic, national, and international issues. Of 18 issue areas Gallup tracked, a majority of Americans said the U.S. lost ground in six, including the economy in general, immigration, and the country's position in the world. A plurality found that the U.S. declined in six other areas, including national infrastructure and energy, education, and trade relations with other countries. Americans perceived standstills in climate change and black people's situation, and were divided between standstills and declines in their perception of healthcare, national defense, and taxes. A plurality felt the U.S. made progress in only one indicator under Biden: the conditions of gay, lesbian, and transgender people.

      "- Greene first drew significant national attention with his book Billion Dollar Baby (1974), a diary of his experiences while touring with rock musician Alice Cooper and portraying Santa Claus during the show.\n",
      "- Greene's primary focus remained his newspaper column, for which he won the National Headliner Award for best column in 1977 from an American journalism group.\n",
      "- Shortly afterward, Greene was hired by Chicago Tribune and began making occasional guest appearances on local television, eventually landing a commentary slot on the ABC news program Nightline .\n",
      "- In January 1980, Greene assisted Los Angeles Police in apprehending a man who had allegedly written letters to Greene as well as to police threatening to go on a killing spree.\n",
      "- At that time Greene's column appeared in approximately 120 newspapers, including one in the Los Angeles community of Huntington Park where the letter writer lived.\n",

      "- A therapist for the birth parents in the custody case, Karen Moriarty, claimed in the book Baby Richard: A Four-Year-Old Child Comes Home that Greene never spoke to the parents, although he covered the subject with 100 columns in which he strongly took the side of the adoptive parents.\n",

      "- In September 2002 Greene was forced to resign from his newspaper column after admitting to an unconsummated extramarital sexual relationship 14 years earlier with a high school student.\n",
      "- Admission of the affair attracted considerable attention.\n",
      "- Reports at the time stated that the woman had reached out to Greene and that he was alarmed enough by whatever she said to contact the FBI, which looked into the matter at a pre-investigative level and did not take any action afterwards.\n",
      "- He was surprised when the Tribune told him his resignation was accepted, and the paper publicly stated that he had been dismissed for \"abusing his position for his own benefit\" but did not provide details at that point.\n",
      "- The full story, that he was basically told to leave and did so on non-criminal grounds, did not emerge fully until months later.\n",
      "- [ citation needed ] The woman with whom Greene had a relationship was 17, legal age in Illinois, and had graduated from high school in the months between their first meeting and his invitation to take her out to dinner.\n",
      "- Greene did not return to newspaper or magazine journalism.\n",

      "## Early life and education\n",
      "- In 1974, Krugman earned his BA summa cum laude in economics from Yale University , where he was a National Merit Scholar . He then went on to pursue a PhD in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1977, he successfully completed his PhD in three years, with a thesis titled Essays on flexible exchange rates. While at MIT, he was part of a small group of MIT students sent to work for the Central Bank of Portugal for three months in the summer of 1976, during the chaotic aftermath of the Carnation Revolution .\n",
      "- Krugman later praised his PhD thesis advisor, Rudi Dornbusch , as \"one of the great economics teachers of all time\" and said that he \"had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths\". In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model. Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, \"[I] knew within a few hours that I had the key to my whole career in hand\". In that same year, Krugman wrote \" The Theory of Interstellar Trade \", a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light. He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was \"an oppressed assistant professor\".\n",
      "\n",
      "## Personal life\n",
      "- Krugman has been married twice. His first wife, Robin L. Bergman, is a designer. He is currently married to Robin Wells , an academic economist who received her BA from the University of Chicago and her PhD from the University of California, Berkeley . She, like Krugman, taught at MIT . Together, Krugman and his wife have co-authored several economics textbooks. In early 2007, rumors began circulating that Krugman's \"son\" was working for Hillary Clinton's campaign . However, Krugman clarified in his op-ed column for the New York Times that he and his wife do not have any children.\n",

      "## Early life and career\n",
      "- In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle , where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University , where he earned a Master of Arts in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964. Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the Ministry of Finance. [ page Â needed ] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old. Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: \"That my father looked nothing like the people around meâthat he was black as pitch, my mother white as milkâbarely registered in my mind.\" He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Education\n",
      "- In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham . He attended Punahou School âa private college preparatory school âwith the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In high school, Obama continued to use the nickname \"Barry\" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980. Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro , in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer .\n",
      "- After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid . In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior , where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA . After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation , where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Post-presidency (2017âpresent)\n",
      "- In July 2024, Obama expressed concerns about Biden's campaign viability after his critically maligned debate performance against former president Trump. On July 21, Biden withdrew his candidacy and swiftly endorsed Vice President Harris right after to run as the Democratic nominee. Obama endorsed Harris alongside his wife Michelle five days later and delivered a speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention formally endorsing her. He joined Harris on the campaign trail in October, traveling to various swing states and emphasizing her record as a prosecutor, senator, and vice president and advocating for increased voter turnout, and his criticisms of Donald Trump and the Republican Party were widely reported by various media outlets. After Trump was declared the winner of the election on November 6, Obama and Michelle congratulated him and Vice Presidentâelect JD Vance while praising the Harris campaign and calling on liberal voters to continue supporting democracy and human rights.\n",

      "=== Paul Krugman ===\n",
      "## Degree Mentions\n",
      "- Krugman was born to a Ukrainian Jewish family, the son of Anita and David Krugman.\n",
      "- In 1914, his maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ukraine , while in 1920, his paternal grandparents arrived from Belarus .\n",
      "- He was born in Albany , New York, spent several years of his childhood in the upstate city of Utica , before growing up from age eight in Merrick , a hamlet in Nassau County , Long Island .\n",
      "- He graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore .\n",
      "- According to Krugman, his interest in economics began with Isaac Asimov 's Foundation novels, in which the social scientists of the future use a new science of \" psychohistory \" to try to save civilization.\n",
      "- Since present-day science fell far short of \"psychohistory\", Krugman turned to economics as the next best thing.\n",
      "- In 1974, Krugman earned his BA summa cum laude in economics from Yale University , where he was a National Merit Scholar .\n",
      "- He then went on to pursue a PhD in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n",
      "- In 1977, he successfully completed his PhD in three years, with a thesis titled Essays on flexible exchange rates.\n",
      "- While at MIT, he was part of a small group of MIT students sent to work for the Central Bank of Portugal for three months in the summer of 1976, during the chaotic aftermath of the Carnation Revolution .\n",
      "- Krugman later praised his PhD thesis advisor, Rudi Dornbusch , as \"one of the great economics teachers of all time\" and said that he \"had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths\".\n",
      "- In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model.\n",
      "- Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, \"[I] knew within a few hours that I had the key to my whole career in hand\".\n",
      "- In that same year, Krugman wrote \" The Theory of Interstellar Trade \", a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light.\n",
      "- He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was \"an oppressed assistant professor\".\n",
      "- Krugman became an assistant professor at Yale University in September 1977.\n",
      "- From 1982 to 1983, Krugman spent a year working at the Reagan White House as a staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers .\n",
      "- Krugman has also taught at Stanford and the London School of Economics .\n",
      "- In 2000, Krugman joined Princeton University as Professor of Economics and International Affairs.\n",
      "- Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association in 2010.\n",
      "- Paul Krugman has written extensively on international economics, including international trade , economic geography , and international finance .\n",
      "- Krugman's International Economics: Theory and Policy , co-authored with Maurice Obstfeld , is a standard undergraduate textbook on international economics.\n",
      "- Krugman also writes on economic topics for the general public, sometimes on international economic topics but also on income distribution and public policy .\n",
      "- The Nobel Prize Committee stated that Krugman's main contribution is his analysis of the effects of economies of scale , combined with the assumption that consumers appreciate diversity, on international trade and on the location of economic activity.\n",
      "- The importance of spatial issues in economics has been enhanced by Krugman's ability to popularize this complicated theory with the help of easy-to-read books and state-of-the-art syntheses.\n",
      "- \"Krugman was beyond doubt the key player in 'placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream' ... and in conferring it the central role it now assumes.\"\n",
      "- Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and HeckscherâOhlin model ) emphasized trade based on the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as a country with a high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity.\n",
      "- Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics , and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale.\n",
      "- However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one).\n",
      "- Krugman modeled a 'preference for diversity' by assuming a CES utility function like that in a 1977 paper by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz .\n",
      "- Many models of international trade now follow Krugman's lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption.\n",
      "- Krugman's theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the \" home market effect \", which would later feature in his work on the new economic geography.\n",
      "- The home market effect \"states that, ceteris paribus , the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net exporter of it\".\n",
      "- The home market effect was an unexpected result, and Krugman initially questioned it, but ultimately concluded that the mathematics of the model were correct.\n",
      "- When there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become ' locked into ' disadvantageous patterns of trade.\n",
      "- Krugman points out that although globalization has been positive on a whole, since the 1980s the process known as hyper-globalization has at least played a part in rising inequality.\n",
      "- Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms.\n",
      "- Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization .\n",
      "- He has also been critical of industrial policy , which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations rent-seeking advantages if \"strategic industries\" can be identified, saying it's not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter.\n",
      "- It took an interval of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged to what is usually called the \" new economic geography \" (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, \"Increasing Returns and Economic Geography\", published in the Journal of Political Economy .\n",
      "- In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was \"obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took me a while to see it.\n",
      "- This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper.\n",
      "- Krugman called the paper \"the love of my life in academic work\".\n",
      "- The \"home market effect\" that Krugman discovered in NTT also features in NEG, which interprets agglomeration \"as the outcome of the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and factor price differences\".\n",
      "- If trade is largely shaped by economies of scale , as Krugman's trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production.\n",
      "- Manufacturing is characterized by increasing returns to scale and less restrictive and expansive land qualifications as compared to agricultural uses.\n",
      "- So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop?\n",
      "- Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand.\n",
      "- Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production.\n",
      "- These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration.\n",
      "- These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.\n",
      "- Krugman has also been influential in the field of international finance .\n",
      "- As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on speculative attacks in the gold market.\n",
      "- Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market , resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking , which showed that misaligned fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly but instead end in a sudden speculative attack .\n",
      "- Krugman's paper is considered one of the main contributions to the 'first generation' of currency crisis models, and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009).\n",
      "- In response to the 2008 financial crisis , Krugman proposed, in an informal \"mimeo\" style of publication, an \"international finance multiplier\", to help explain the unexpected speed with which the global crisis had occurred.\n",
      "- ... ] lose heavily in one market ... they find themselves undercapitalized, and have to sell off assets across the board.\n",
      "- This drives down prices, putting pressure on the balance sheets of other HLIs, and so on.\"\n",
      "- Such a rapid contagion had hitherto been considered unlikely because of \"decoupling\" in a globalized economy .\n",
      "- Krugman has done much to revive discussion of the liquidity trap as a topic in economics.\n",
      "- The debate he started at that time over liquidity traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature.\n",
      "- Krugman had argued in The Return of Depression Economics that Japan was in a liquidity trap in the late 1990s, since the central bank could not drop interest rates any lower to escape economic stagnation.\n",
      "- The core of Krugman's policy proposal for addressing Japan's liquidity trap was inflation targeting , which, he argued \"most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources\".\n",
      "- This mimeo-draft was soon cited, but was also misread by some as repeating his earlier advice that Japan's best hope was in \"turning on the printing presses\", as recommended by Milton Friedman , John Makin, and others.\n",
      "- Krugman has since drawn parallels between Japan's 'lost decade' and the late 2000s recession , arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are mired in a liquidity trap.\n",
      "- In response to economists who point out that the Japanese economy recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system.\n",
      "- Krugman was one of the most prominent advocates of the 2008â2009 Keynesian resurgence , so much so that economics commentator Noah Smith referred to it as the \"Krugman insurgency\".\n",
      "- His view that most peer-reviewed macroeconomic research since the mid-1960s is wrong, preferring simpler models developed in the 1930s, has been criticized by some modern economists, like John H. Cochrane .\n",
      "- In June 2012, Krugman and Richard Layard launched A manifesto for economic sense , where they call for greater use of fiscal stimulus policy to reduce unemployment and foster growth.\n",
      "- The manifesto received over four thousand signatures within two days of its launch, and has attracted both positive and critical responses.\n",
      "- Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (informally the Nobel Prize in Economics), the sole recipient for 2008.\n",
      "- This prize includes an award of about $1.4 Â million and was given to Krugman for his work associated with New Trade Theory and the New Economic Geography.\n",
      "- In the words of the prize committee, \"By having integrated economies of scale into explicit general equilibrium models, Paul Krugman has deepened our understanding of the determinants of trade and the location of economic activity.\"\n",
      "- A May 2011 Hamilton College analysis of 26 politicians, journalists, and media commentators who made predictions in major newspaper columns or television news shows from September 2007 to December 2008 found that Krugman was the most accurate.\n",
      "- Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or worse than a coin flip.\n",
      "- Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, Maureen Dowd .\n",
      "- Krugman was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2011.\n",
      "- Foreign Policy named Krugman one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers \"for wielding his acid pen against austerity\".\n",
      "- In the 1990s, besides academic books and textbooks, Krugman increasingly began writing books for a general audience on issues he considered important for public policy.\n",
      "- In The Age of Diminished Expectations (1990), he wrote in particular about the increasing US income inequality in the \" New Economy \" of the 1990s.\n",
      "- In September 2003, Krugman published a collection of his columns under the title, The Great Unraveling , about the Bush administration 's economic and foreign policies and the US economy in the early 2000s.\n",
      "- Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis.\n",
      "- In 2007, Krugman published The Conscience of a Liberal , whose title refers to Barry Goldwater 's Conscience of a Conservative .\n",
      "- In Conscience , Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.\n",
      "- Krugman also argued that Republicans owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South.\n",
      "- Krugman argues that Ronald Reagan had used the \" Southern Strategy \" to signal sympathy for racism without saying anything overtly racist, citing as an example Reagan's coining of the term \" welfare queen \".\n",
      "- In his book, Krugman proposed a \"new New Deal \", which included placing more emphasis on social and medical programs and less on national defense.\n",
      "- In his review of Conscience of a Liberal , the liberal journalist and author Michael Tomasky credited Krugman with a commitment \"to accurate history even when some fudging might be in order for the sake of political expediency\".\n",
      "- In a review for The New York Times , Pulitzer Prize -winning historian David M. Kennedy stated: \"Krugman's chapter on the imperative need for health care reform is the best in this book, a rueful reminder of the kind of skilled and accessible economic analysis of which he is capable\".\n",
      "- In late 2008, Krugman published a substantial updating of an earlier work, entitled The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 .\n",
      "- In 2012, Krugman published End This Depression Now!\n",
      "- , a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy â people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment.\n",
      "- Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.\n",
      "- Martin Wolf has written that Krugman is both the \"most hated and most admired columnist in the US\".\n",
      "- Economist J. Peter Neary has noted that Krugman \"has written on a wide range of topics, always combining one of the best prose styles in the profession with an ability to construct elegant, insightful and useful models\".\n",
      "- Through his extensive writings, including a regular column for The New York Times , monographs and textbooks at every level, and books on economics and current affairs for the general public ... he has probably done more than any other writer to explain economic principles to a wide audience.\"\n",
      "- Krugman has been described as the most controversial economist in his generation and according to Michael Tomasky since 1992 he has moved \"from being a center-left scholar to being a liberal polemicist\".\n",
      "- From the mid-1990s onwards, Krugman wrote for Fortune (1997â99) and Slate (1996â99), and then for The Harvard Business Review , Foreign Policy , The Economist , Harper's , and Washington Monthly .\n",
      "- In this period Krugman critiqued various positions commonly taken on economic issues from across the political spectrum, from protectionism and opposition to the World Trade Organization on the left to supply-side economics on the right.\n",
      "- During the 1992 presidential campaign , Krugman praised Bill Clinton 's economic plan in The New York Times , and Clinton's campaign used some of Krugman's work on income inequality .\n",
      "- At the time, it was considered likely that Clinton would offer him a position in the new administration, but allegedly Krugman's volatility and outspokenness caused Clinton to look elsewhere.\n",
      "- Krugman later said that he was \"temperamentally unsuited for that kind of role.\n",
      "- In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Krugman added, \"you have to be reasonably organized ...\n",
      "- In 1999, near the height of the dot com boom , The New York Times approached Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on \"the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity\".\n",
      "- His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush 's policy proposals.\n",
      "- According to Krugman, this was partly due to \"the silence of the media â those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about ...\" Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves.\n",
      "- After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut in the midst of the slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration.\n",
      "- Partly as a result, Krugman's twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore , \"the most important political columnist in America ... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years â the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels.\"\n",
      "- In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as \"good guys but not as forceful as I'd like ...\n",
      "- Krugman says he's more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, \"now, I'm trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success.\n",
      "- Krugman's columns have drawn criticism as well as praise.\n",
      "- A 2003 article in The Economist questioned Krugman's \"growing tendency to attribute all the world's ills to George Bush\", citing critics who felt that \"his relentless partisanship is getting in the way of his argument\" and claiming errors of economic and political reasoning in his columns.\n",
      "- Daniel Okrent , a former The New York Times ombudsman , in his farewell column, criticized Krugman for what he said was \"the disturbing habit of shaping, slicing and selectively citing numbers in a fashion that pleases his acolytes but leaves him open to substantive assaults\".\n",
      "- Krugman's New York Times blog was \"The Conscience of a Liberal\", devoted largely to economics and politics.\n",
      "- Five days after 9/11 terrorist attacks, Krugman argued in his column that the calamity was \"partly self-inflicted\", citing poor pay and training for airport security driven by the transfer of responsibility for airport security from government to airlines.\n",
      "- According to Larissa MacFarquhar of The New Yorker , while some people [ who? ]\n",
      "- Similarly, on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 on the United States Krugman again provoked a controversy by accusing on his New York Times blog former U.S. President George W. Bush and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani of rushing \"to cash in on the horror\" after the attacks and describing the anniversary as \"an occasion for shame\".\n",
      "- Krugman was noteworthy for his opposition to the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders .\n",
      "- On January 19, 2016, he wrote an article which criticized Bernie Sanders for his perceived lack of political realism, compared Sanders' plans for healthcare and financial reform unfavorably to those of Hillary Clinton , and cited criticisms of Sanders from other liberal policy wonks like Mike Konczal and Ezra Klein .\n",
      "- Later, Krugman wrote an article which accused Sanders of \"[going] for easy slogans over hard thinking\" and attacking Hillary Clinton in a way that was \"just plain dishonest\".\n",
      "- On the 12 July 2016, Krugman tweeted \" leprechaun economics \", in response to Central Statistics Office (Ireland) data that 2015 GDP grew 26.3% and 2015 GNP grew 18.7%.\n",
      "- The leprechaun economics affair (proved in 2018 to be Apple restructuring its double Irish subsidiaries), led to the Central Bank of Ireland introducing a new economic statistic, Modified gross national income (or GNI*) to better measure the Irish economy (2016 Irish GDP is 143% of 2016 Irish GNI*).\n",
      "- The term leprechaun economics has since been used by Krugman, and others, to describe distorted/unsound economic data.\n",
      "- Krugman's use of the term leprechaun to refer to Ireland and its people has raised rebuke.\n",
      "- In June 2021, Krugman wrote an article titled, \"Yellen's New Alliance Against Leprechauns\".\n",
      "- Following the article, the Irish Ambassador to the US, Daniel Mulhall , wrote a letter to his publisher saying, \"This is not the first time your columnist has used the word 'leprechaun' when referring to Ireland, and I see it as my duty to point out that this represents an unacceptable slur.\"\n",
      "- Krugman harshly criticized the Trump administration .\n",
      "- He has also remarked several times on how Trump tempts him to assume the worst, such that he has to be careful to check his personal beliefs against the weight of evidence.\n",
      "- [ citation needed ] In January 2025, speaking on his departure from The New York Times the previous month, Krugman said that he found the back-and-forth with his editor had become intrusive and tiresome.\n",
      "- In a 1994 Foreign Affairs article, Paul Krugman argued that it was a myth that the economic successes of the East Asian 'tigers' constituted an economic miracle.\n",
      "- He argued that their rise was fueled by mobilizing resources and that their growth rates would inevitably slow.\n",
      "- His article helped popularize the argument made by Lawrence Lau and Alwyn Young , among others, that the growth of economies in East Asia was not the result of new and original economic models, but rather from high capital investment and increasing labor force participation , and that total factor productivity had not increased.\n",
      "- Krugman argued that in the long term, only increasing total factor productivity can lead to sustained economic growth .\n",
      "- Krugman's article was highly criticized in many Asian countries when it first appeared, and subsequent studies disputed some of Krugman's conclusions.\n",
      "- However, it also stimulated a great deal of research, and may have caused the Singapore government to provide incentives for technological progress.\n",
      "- During the 1997 Asian financial crisis , Krugman advocated currency controls as a way to mitigate the crisis.\n",
      "- Writing in a Fortune magazine article, he suggested exchange controls as \"a solution so unfashionable, so stigmatized, that hardly anyone has dared suggest it\".\n",
      "- Malaysia was the only country that adopted such controls, and although the Malaysian government credited its rapid economic recovery on currency controls, the relationship is disputed.\n",
      "- An empirical study found that the Malaysian policies produced faster economic recovery and smaller declines in employment and real wages.\n",
      "- Krugman later stated that the controls might not have been necessary at the time they were applied, but that nevertheless \"Malaysia has proved a point â namely, that controlling capital in a crisis is at least feasible.\"\n",
      "- Krugman more recently pointed out that emergency capital controls have even been endorsed by the IMF, and are no longer considered radical policy.\n",
      "- In the early 2000s, Krugman repeatedly criticized the Bush tax cuts , both before and after they were enacted.\n",
      "- Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged the budget deficit without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy â worsening income distribution in the US.\n",
      "- Krugman advocated lower interest rates (to promote investment and spending on housing and other durable goods), and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax cuts, would only temporarily increase the budget deficit.\n",
      "- In August 2005, after Alan Greenspan expressed concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan's earlier reluctance to regulate the mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that \"[he's] like a man who suggests leaving the barn door ajar, and then â after the horse is gone â delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up.\"\n",
      "- Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis .\n",
      "- Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives , financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act , which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks , investment banks and insurance companies from merging.\n",
      "- Krugman also was critical of some of the Obama administration 's economic policies.\n",
      "- He criticized the Obama stimulus plan as being too small and inadequate given the size of the economy and the banking rescue plan as misdirected; Krugman wrote in The New York Times : \"an overwhelming majority [of the American public] believes that the government is spending too much to help large financial institutions.\n",
      "- In particular, he considered the Obama administration's actions to prop up the US financial system in 2009 to be impractical and unduly favorable to Wall Street bankers.\n",
      "- In anticipation of President Obama's Job Summit in December 2009, Krugman said in a Fresh Dialogues interview, \"This jobs summit can't be an empty exercise ... he can't come out with a proposal for $10 or $20 Â Billion of stuff because people will view that as a joke.\n",
      "- Krugman has criticized China's exchange rate policy, which he believes to be a significant drag on global economic recovery from the Late-2000s recession , and he has advocated a \"surcharge\" on Chinese imports to the US in response.\n",
      "- Jeremy Warner of The Daily Telegraph accused Krugman of advocating a return to self-destructive protectionism .\n",
      "- In April 2010, as the Senate began considering new financial regulations, Krugman argued that the regulations should not only regulate financial innovation, but also tax financial industry profits and remuneration.\n",
      "- He cited a paper by Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny released the previous week, which concludes that most innovation was in fact about \"providing investors with false substitutes for [traditional] assets like bank deposits\", and once investors realize the sheer number of securities that are unsafe a \"flight to safety\" occurs which necessarily leads to \"financial fragility\".\n",
      "- In his June 28, 2010, column in The New York Times , in light of the recent G-20 Toronto Summit , Krugman criticized world leaders for agreeing to halve deficits by 2013.\n",
      "- Krugman claimed that these efforts could lead the global economy into the early stages of a \"third depression\" and leave \"millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs\".\n",
      "- In a 2014 review of Thomas Piketty 's Capital in the Twenty-First Century he stated we are in a Second Gilded Age .\n",
      "- Krugman identifies as a Keynesian and a saltwater economist , and he has criticized the freshwater school on macroeconomics .\n",
      "- Although he has used New Keynesian theory in his work, he has also criticized it for lacking predictive power and for hewing to ideas like the efficient-market hypothesis and rational expectations .\n",
      "- During the Great Recession , he remarked that he is \"gravitating towards a Keynes - Fisher - Minsky view of macroeconomics\".\n",
      "- Post-Keynesian observers cite commonalities between Krugman's views and those of the Post-Keynesian school, although Krugman has been critical of some Post-Keynesian economists such as John Kenneth Galbraith â whose works The New Industrial State (1967) and Economics in Perspective (1987) Krugman has referred to as not \"real economic theory\" and \"remarkably ill-informed\" respectively.\n",
      "- In recent academic work, he has collaborated with Gauti Eggertsson on a New Keynesian model of debt-overhang and debt-driven slumps, inspired by the writings of Irving Fisher , Hyman Minsky , and Richard Koo .\n",
      "- Their work argues that during a debt-driven slump, the \" paradox of toil \", together with the paradox of flexibility , can exacerbate a liquidity trap , reducing demand and employment.\n",
      "- Krugman's support for free trade in the 1980sâ1990s provoked some ire from the anti-globalization movement .\n",
      "- In 1987 he quipped that, \"If there were an Economist's Creed, it would surely contain the affirmations 'I understand the Principle of Comparative Advantage' and 'I advocate Free Trade'.\"\n",
      "- However, Krugman argues in the same article that, given the findings of New Trade Theory, \"[free trade] has shifted from optimum to reasonable rule of thumb ... it can never again be asserted as the policy that economic theory tells us is always right.\"\n",
      "- In the article, Krugman comes out in favor of free trade given the enormous political costs of actively engaging in strategic trade policy and because there is no clear method for a government to discover which industries will ultimately yield positive returns.\n",
      "- In 1994, Krugman criticized the notion of national competitiveness, particularly comparisons of nations as competing corporations.\n",
      "- Krugman noted that a country's economic success does not need to come at the expense of a rival nation, as if they were two competing companies selling similar products.\n",
      "- Instead, foreign nations typically serve as export markets for a nation's goods, as well as suppliers of useful imports.\n",
      "- In the midst of the 2009 Great Recession, Krugman made a significant departure from his general support for free trade, entertaining the idea of a 25% tariff on Chinese imports as a retaliation for China's policy of maintaining a low value for the renminbi , which many saw as hostile currency manipulation, artificially making their exports more competitive.\n",
      "- In 2015, Krugman noted his ambivalence about the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership , as the agreement was not mainly about trade and, \"whatever you may say about the benefits of free trade, most of those benefits have already been realized\" [by existing agreements].\n",
      "- After the 2016 elections, and Trump's moves towards protectionism, he wrote that while protectionism can make economies less efficient and reduce long-term growth, it would not directly cause recessions.\n",
      "- He believes that the US should not repeat Reagan's 1981 policy on taxes and quotas on imported products, as even if it does not produce a recession, protectionism would shock \"value chains\" and disrupt jobs and communities in the same way as free trade in the past.\n",
      "- Krugman recommended against the abandonment of NAFTA, because it could cause economic losses and disruptions to businesses, jobs, and communities.\n",
      "- In the late 2010s, Krugman admitted that the models that scholars used to measure the impact of globalization in the 1990s underestimated the effect on jobs and inequality in developed countries such as the US.\n",
      "- He noted that although free trade has harmed some industries, communities, and some workers, it remains a win-win system overall, enriching both parties to the agreement at the national level; a trade war is equivalently negative for the nations involved, even while it may benefit some individuals or industries within each nation.\n",
      "- In 2006, Krugman wrote: \"[i]mmigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants.\n",
      "- That's just supply and demand: we're talking about large increases in the number of low-skill workers relative to other inputs into production, so it's inevitable that this means a fall in wages ... the fiscal burden of low-wage immigrants is also pretty clear,\" citing an estimate of 0.25% of GDP from the National Research Council .\n",
      "- However, in 2024, he reported that âmost labor economists now believe that immigrants donât do much head-to-head competition with native-born workers; they bring different skills and take different jobs.\n",
      "- Krugman has called for a transition to a green economy .\n",
      "- On that stuff, don't worry about paying for it.\n",
      "- Debt as an issue is vastly overstated, and a lot of these things pay for themselves.\n",
      "- Krugman describes himself as liberal and has explained that he views the term \"liberal\" in the American context to mean \"more or less what social democratic means in Europe\".\n",
      "- In a 2009 Newsweek article, Evan Thomas described Krugman as having \"all the credentials of a ranking member of the East coast liberal establishment\" but also as someone who is anti-establishment, a \"scourge of the Bush administration\", and a critic of the Obama administration.\n",
      "- In 1996, Newsweek ' s Michael Hirsh remarked, \"Say this for Krugman: though an unabashed liberal ... he's ideologically colorblind.\n",
      "- Krugman has at times advocated free markets in contexts where they are often viewed as controversial.\n",
      "- He has written against rent control and land-use restrictions in favor of market supply and demand, likened the opposition against free trade and globalization to the opposition against evolution via natural selection (1996), opposed farm subsidies , argued that sweatshops are preferable to unemployment, dismissed the case for living wages (1998), and argued against mandates, subsidies, and tax breaks for ethanol (2000).\n",
      "- In 2003, he questioned the usefulness of NASA 's manned space flights given the available technology and their high financial cost compared to their general benefits.\n",

      "- Krugman endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n",
      "- Krugman has criticized the Republican Party leadership for what he sees as a strategic (but largely tacit) reliance on racial divisions.\n",
      "- Krugman worked for Martin Feldstein when the latter was appointed chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan .\n",
      "- I was then and still am an unabashed defender of the welfare state , which I regard as the most decent social arrangement yet devised.\"\n",
      "- Krugman found the time \"thrilling, then disillusioning\".\n",
      "- According to Krugman, Gordon Brown and his party were unfairly blamed for the 2008 financial crisis .\n",
      "- Krugman asserted that Brown \"defined the character of the worldwide financial rescue effort\" and urged British voters not to support the opposition Conservative Party in the 2010 general election , arguing their Party Leader David Cameron \"has had little to offer other than to raise the red flag of fiscal panic\".\n",
      "- Krugman has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump and his administration.\n",
      "- His criticisms have included the president's climate change proposals, economic policy, the Republican tax plan and Trump's foreign policy initiatives.\n",
      "- Krugman often used his op-ed column in The New York Times to set out arguments against the president's policies.\n",
      "- On election night in 2016, Krugman wrongly predicted in a New York Times op-ed that the markets would never recover under Trump and stated \"first-pass answer is never\" but retracted the call in the same publication three days later.\n",
      "- Krugman stated \"I get a 'fake news award' for a bad market call, retracted 3 days later, from 2000-lie man, who still won't admit he lost the popular vote.\n",
      "- In his New York Times column, Krugman described Russia as a \" Potemkin superpower\" in reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine .\n",
      "- He stated that \"Russia is even weaker than most people, myself included, seem to have realized\", that the military performance of Russia \"has been less effective than advertised\" in a stalemate at the beginning of the invasion, and that Russia encountered serious logistical problems.\n",
      "- Krugman observed that the country's total gross domestic product is only a bit more than half as large as those of countries such as Britain and France, despite Russia's greater landmass, total population and natural resource endowment.\n",

      "- Following the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, Obama experienced a small poll bounce and steadily maintained 50â53 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s.\n",
      "- After his second inauguration in 2013, Obama's approval ratings remained stable around 52 percent before declining for the rest of the year and eventually bottoming out at 39 percent in December.\n",
      "- In polling conducted before the 2014 midterm elections , Obama's approval ratings were at their lowest with his disapproval rating reaching a high of 57 percent.\n",
      "- According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating reached 50 percent in March 2016, a level unseen since May 2013.\n",
      "- In polling conducted January 16â19, 2017, Obama's final approval rating was 59 percent, which placed him on par with George H. W. Bush and Dwight D. Eisenhower , whose final Gallup ratings also measured in the high 50s.\n",
      "- Obama has maintained relatively positive public perceptions after his presidency.\n",
      "- In Gallup's retrospective approval polls of former presidents, Obama garnered a 63 percent approval rating in 2018 and again in 2023, ranking him the fourth most popular president since World War II.\n",
      "- Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.\n",
      "- In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune , Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.\n",
      "- In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.\n",
      "- On October 9, 2009âonly nine months into his first termâthe Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\", which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.\n",
      "- He himself called it a \"call to action\" and remarked: \"I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations\".\n",
      "- In 2009, the saying \"thanks, Obama\" first appeared in a Twitter hashtag , \"#thanks Obama\", and was later used in a demotivational poster.\n",
      "- It was later adopted satirically to blame Obama for any socio-economic ills.\n",
      "- Obama himself used the phrase in video in 2015 and 2016.\n",
      "- In 2017, the phrase was used by Stephen Colbert to express gratitude to Obama on his last day in office.\n",
      "- Obama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century.\n",
      "- Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with \"a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals.\"\n",
      "- Zeitzer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act .\n",
      "- Zeitzer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama \"turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder.\"\n",
      "- Zeitzer calls this the \"defining paradox of Obama's presidency\".\n",
      "- The Brookings Institution noted that Obama passed \"only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)âand a fragile one at thatâthe legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.\"\n",
      "- David W. Wise noted that Obama fell short \"in areas many Progressives hold dear\", including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare.\n",
      "- Wise called Obama's legacy that of \"a disappointingly conventional president\".\n",
      "- Obama's most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020.\n",
      "- Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a \"skinny repeal\", have thus far failed.\n",
      "- However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019.\n",
      "- Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.\n",
      "- According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , the Obama administration created 11.3 Â million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term.\n",
      "- In 2010, Obama signed into effect the DoddâFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n",
      "- In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 , which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr.\n",
      "- The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States , and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.\n",
      "- As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.\n",
      "- In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGBT people; the law went into effect the following year.\n",
      "- In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.\n",
      "- A Gallup poll , taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.\n",
      "- Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban .\n",
      "- In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.\n",
      "- Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan , 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.\n",
      "- According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics , from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent.\n",
      "- This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody of any president since Jimmy Carter .\n",
      "- Human Rights Watch (HRW) called Obama's human rights record \"mixed\", adding that \"he has often treated human rights as a secondary interestânice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed.\"\n",
      "- Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating.\n",
      "- The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library .\n",
      "- Obama received the Norwegian Nobel Committee 's Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, The Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education's Ambassador of Humanity Award in 2014, the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2017, and the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Ripple of Hope Award in 2018.\n",
      "- He was named TIME Magazine 's Time Person of the Year in 2008 and 2012.\n",
      "- He also received two Grammy Awards for Best Spoken Word Album for Dreams from My Father (2006), and The Audacity of Hope (2008) as well as two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Narrator for Our Great National Parks (2022), and Working: What We Do All Day (2023).\n",
